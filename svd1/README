Notes about svd1:

- svd1 performs SVD factorization using SGD, training on 
  idx 1 training data
- makes predictions on qual.dta (idx 4)
- can modify number of epochs (max_epochs), eta (learning rate), 
  and regularization parameter (reg) in main.cpp
- can set output file name in svd1.cpp (currently "submission.dta")
- to compile: g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp svd1.cpp -o svd, then run ./svd
- 'submission2.dta' currently gives qual RMSE -14%
